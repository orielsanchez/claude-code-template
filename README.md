## What's This?

A complete development environment template that enforces **Test-Driven Development**, **quality-first coding**, and **systematic workflows** when working with Claude Code. Includes 6 powerful commands, automated quality checks, and learning protocols to build senior-level development skills.

**Perfect for:** Teams wanting consistent, high-quality AI-assisted development.

### What is Claude Code?

**Claude Code** is an AI-powered command-line tool that revolutionizes software development by embedding Claude Opus 4 directly into your terminal. Unlike traditional AI coding assistants that just suggest code, Claude Code is **agentic** - meaning it can:

- **Understand your entire codebase** without manual context selection
- **Make coordinated changes** across multiple files
- **Execute real actions** like running tests, creating commits, and fixing bugs
- **Work directly in your terminal** with VS Code, JetBrains, and other IDEs

### Why Agentic AI Development?

Traditional AI tools require you to copy/paste code and explain context repeatedly. **Agentic AI development** means:

‚úÖ **Full codebase awareness** - Claude understands your project structure, patterns, and dependencies  
‚úÖ **Multi-file coordination** - Make complex changes across multiple files seamlessly  
‚úÖ **End-to-end workflows** - From writing tests to committing code, all in natural language  
‚úÖ **Learning preservation** - Build your skills while building your product

### Quick Example

Instead of this traditional workflow:
```
1. Read documentation 
2. Write code manually
3. Copy/paste to AI for review
4. Manually fix issues
5. Repeat...
```

You get this agentic workflow:
```bash
/tdd "user authentication with JWT tokens"
# Claude writes tests, implements code, runs tests, fixes issues
/check  # Validates quality automatically
/ship "add JWT authentication system"  # Creates commit with docs
```

### Getting Started with Claude Code

**First time?** Install Claude Code:
```bash
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
claude  # Start the interactive session
```

**Then use this template** (instructions below) to get systematic workflows and quality enforcement.

### Why Use This Template?

**Raw Claude Code** is powerful but unstructured. **This template** provides:

üéØ **Systematic Workflows** - Research ‚Üí Plan ‚Üí Test ‚Üí Implement ‚Üí Ship  
üõ°Ô∏è **Quality Enforcement** - Zero tolerance for bad patterns, automatic checks  
üìö **Learning-First Approach** - Build senior-level skills, not just working code  
‚ö° **6 Power Commands** - `/tdd`, `/check`, `/ship`, `/next`, `/prompt`, `/claude-md`  
üîß **Multi-Language Support** - Works with any tech stack  
üìñ **Battle-Tested Practices** - Based on real-world AI-assisted development

**Think of it as:** Claude Code + Engineering Discipline = Production-Ready Development

## Features

- **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** workflow with AI assistance
- **Quality-first approach** with automated checks and zero-tolerance policies
- **Learning-preservation protocols** to build senior-level skills
- **Systematic development workflow**: Research ‚Üí Plan ‚Üí Test ‚Üí Implement ‚Üí Ship
- **Complete command library** for streamlined development
- **No-emoji policy** for clean, professional code

## Commands Overview

| Command | Purpose | Example |
|---------|---------|---------|
| **`/tdd`** | Start with tests | `/tdd "user login"` |
| **`/debug`** | Systematic debugging | `/debug "login fails"` |
| **`/refactor`** | Code improvement | `/refactor "simplify auth"` |
| **`/check`** | Quality gate | `/check` |
